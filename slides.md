# The Lore

# June, 2015

- I was working on one of my Go projects
- Created a [`release.sh`](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody/commit/5d06dae0c78d1655fc243183f96d8a0a7a3cc197)
- Unassuming
- Similar to many others out there

# March, 2016

- I now have a dozen of Go projects
- All of them need releasing
- Moved that script into its [own repository](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody/commit/5d06dae0c78d1655fc243183f96d8a0a7a3cc197)
- Configuration via `--flags`
- It sucked, but scratched the itch

# December, 2016

- Doing OSS during holidays
- "I need Homebrew"

# Lessons learned

# GoReleaser is boring software

And _boring is good_, actually.

Boring is _predictable_.

Turns out people want _predictable_ when releasing their software.

Incidentally, most people don't want to work on boring things. ðŸ’µ

# Naming things is hard

- "it releases Go binaries, its GoReleaser"
- "gore leaser"
- mix up with `gorelease` (without the `r`)
- locked in to the tech

# _"die Welt ist ein Dorf"_

Because of GoReleaser, I got to meet and chat with a lot of amazing people.

Who you know matters a lot more than I thought back then.

The world is indeed a village - **be nice.**

# Enterprise plans should be expensive

- **So. Much. Paperwork.**
- They ask a lot about you, your product, and your processes
- It makes sense to charge extra, as you'll spend hours filling this stuff
- Most of it doesn't matter in our specific case, they ask anyway

# Things I would have done differently

- Launched multiple languages back in 2018
- Created the Pro version earlier, circa 2019
- Both these would have lead me to:
  - Change the license in time
  - Change the name before being so well known

# The hacker way

- Solve the problem you already have instead of
  finding a problem for the solution you want to implement
- Try to think like a product manager
- Flexibility needs to be intentional
- Simple is good, but it's not easy

^ User should be able to start without reading dozens of docs

# The Future

- Support more languages
- Support more distribution channels
- tl;dr keep working on it

# Thanks!
