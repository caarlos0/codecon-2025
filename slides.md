# The Lore

# 2015: The beginning

- I was working on one of my Go projects
- Created a [`release.sh`](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody/commit/5d06dae0c78d1655fc243183f96d8a0a7a3cc197)
- Unassuming
- Similar to many others out there

# 2016: Rewrite in Go

- I now have a dozen of Go projects
- Moved that script into its [own repository](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody/commit/5d06dae0c78d1655fc243183f96d8a0a7a3cc197)
- Doing OSS during holidays, needed more features
- Rewrote it in Go
- Shared it on `/r/golang` and Twitter

^ All of them need releasing
Configuration via `--flags`
It sucked, but scratched the itch
"I need Homebrew"
"It'll suck to do that with bash..."
"Gonna make this into a Go project!"

# 2017: Spreading the word

- Kept adding features to it
- Wife drew the mascot/logo
- Using it in all my projects

# 2018: Burning out

# Lessons learned

# Boring software

_Boring is good_, actually.

Boring is _predictable_.

Turns out people want _predictable_ when releasing their software.

# Distribution

You can game it a little bit, but luck still plays a big role.

Good README, some art/screenshots helps.

# Naming things is hard

- "it releases Go binaries, its GoReleaser"
- "gore leaser"
- mix up with `gorelease` (without the `r`)
- locked in to the tech

# _"die Welt ist ein Dorf"_

Because of GoReleaser, I got to meet and chat with a lot of amazing people.

Who you know matters a lot more than I thought back then.

# Enterprise plans should be expensive

- **So. Much. Paperwork.**
- They ask a lot about you, your product, and your processes
- It makes sense to charge extra, as you'll spend hours filling this stuff
- Most of it doesn't matter in our specific case, they ask anyway

# Licensing

- MIT is probably too permissive
- If you plan to monetize, mind the license

# Flexibility

The more flexible, the crazier it gets.

TODO: more

# Simplicity

Scope creeps into every project that lives long enough.

TODO: more

# Building products

Solve the problem you already have instead of finding a problem for the
solution you thing would be fun to implement.

# The Future

- Support more languages
- Support more distribution channels
- tl;dr keep working on it

# Thanks!
