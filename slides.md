# The Lore

![](./presentation2.png)

---

## 2015: Epoch

- I was working on one of my Go projects
- Created a [`release.sh`](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody/commit/5d06dae0c78d1655fc243183f96d8a0a7a3cc197)
- Didn't think anything of it
- Same as thousands before

# Lessons learned

![](./presentation2.png)

---

## Boring software

- People want _predictability_ instead of _novelty_ when releasing their software
- Boring is _predictable_
- _Boring is good_, actually

---

## Distribution

- Really hard, unless you are a _tech influencer_
- Creator and creation get conflated
- If you are a _tech influencer_, then you might have other problems

---

## Naming things

- "it releases Go binaries, its a Go Releaser"

![inline](./gore_leaser_2.png)

---

## Naming things

- "it releases Go binaries, its a Go Releaser"
- "gore leaser"
- mix up with `gorelease` (without the `r`)
- the **Go** prefix

![right](./gore_leaser.png)

---

## Pricing

- Harder than pricing physical products
- _Guess_ based on what you know and what you think it's worth
- Enterprises usually expect overcharging (legal, forms, etc)

---

## Licensing

- MIT is probably too permissive
- Changing later might feel like bait-and-switch
- Consider changing it earlier rather than later

---

## Flexibility, Simplicity, and finding balance

- I love flexible software
- It leads to madness
- I hate flexible software
- Scope creep, accidental complexity

![right 140%](./seen-things.gif)

---

## Building products

- Side projects: for fun and studying
- Products: solving problems

---

# The Future

![](./presentation2.png)

---

## The future

- Support more languages and distribution channels
- Improve docs, error messages, small feats, etc
- tl;dr keep working on it
