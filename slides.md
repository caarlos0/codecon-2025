# The Lore

# June, 2015

- I was working on another project I had
- Created a [`release.sh`](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody/commit/5d06dae0c78d1655fc243183f96d8a0a7a3cc197)
- Few days later: [added more stuff to it](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody/commit/5d06dae0c78d1655fc243183f96d8a0a7a3cc197)

# March, 2016

- Moved that script into its [own repository](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody/commit/5d06dae0c78d1655fc243183f96d8a0a7a3cc197)
- I needed to use it in more repositories

# December, 2016

- "I need Homebrew"
- "It'll suck to do that with bash..."
- "Gonna make this a Go project!"
- And so [I did](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/commit/8b63e6555be45234c4c2a69576ca2ddab705302c)!
- Posted it on `/r/golang` and Twitter

# What I learned

# GoReleaser is boring software

And boring is _good_, actually.

Boring is _predictable_.

Turns out people want _predictable_ when releasing their software.

And most people don't want to work on boring things.

Which is why _GoReleaser Pro_ sells.

# Naming things is hard

I didn't think about it _at all_ ðŸ«£

- "it releases Go binaries, its GoReleaser"
- "gore leaser"
- mix up with `gorelease` (without the `r`)
- doesn't sound like it supports more languages

# _die Welt ist ein Dorf_

Because of GoReleaser, I got to meet a lot of amazing people, got invited into events, got job opportunities...

People will also try to take advantage of you and your product platform.

The world is indeed a village.

**Be nice.**

# Luck

People like to brag it's all them - and they have their credit, for sure, but luck also plays in subtle but important ways.

# Original marketing x OSS

- Anything goes
- It's all _vibes_
- See HTMX on X for example

# Enterprise plans should be expensive

- **So. Much. Paperwork.**
- They ask a lot about you, your product, and your processes
- It makes sense to charge extra, as you'll spend hours filling this stuff

# Timing

- Should probably have made the Pro version earlier
- Should probably have added more languages earlier
- Should probably have changed the license early, now I probably never gonna

# Future

- Support more languages and distribution channels
-
